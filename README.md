The code attached is our final webserver project. We have implemented all basic test cases, as well as caching. We did not add support for multithreading. To compile everything, in the terminal run "make" and then "./webserv <port>". To add support for caching, add "-c" as a command option. 

The cache replacement implemented is a FIFO replacement.
